# yayinstall
This installs the famous Arch Linux AUR Helper "yay" through a bash script.
# Information about this tool
This tool is not in any way trying to replace anything. It is just made for convience for me and other people who do not want to install all the tools manually to get "yay" and would like a script to do it for them. This is tested and developed for Arch Linux.
